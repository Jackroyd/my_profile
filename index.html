      <p>Hey! I'm Josh. I graduated in Environmental Biology around 6 years ago. Since then I've been a chef, a baker, a customer support manager and a data analyst. For 2 years I worked for a tech start up in customer support, I'm looking forward to fixing (and creating) bugs rather than having to report them. I'm now working as a data analyst and have a few years experience with Python and SQL. I'd be keen to work again for a tech start up and I love being part of the product development cycle.</p>
